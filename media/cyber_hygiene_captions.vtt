Every time you go online, you leave
digital footprints.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.400
Without good cyber hygiene, those
footprints can lead cyber criminals

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.400
straight to your personal information.
Cyber hygiene refers to best practices

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.280
that help keep your online accounts,
devices, and data secure.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.860
It's like personal hygiene. Neglect it and
you invite trouble.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
But practice it and you stay protected. So
what does it take to practice

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.440
good cyber hygiene? First, always enable
multi-factor

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.980
authentication, or MFA. This adds an extra
layer of security,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.020
making it harder for hackers to get in.
Even if a hacker guesses your password,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.380
they won't be able to get past that second
layer of protection.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.560
Next, strong passwords matter. A good
password is at least

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.220
16 characters long and completely random.
Avoid using predictable

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.960
passwords or reusing passwords across
accounts. A password manager

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.720
can help you generate and store secure
passwords easily.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.280
Another key habit? Keep your software and
devices updated.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.620
Updates do more than add new features.
They fix security holes that hackers

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.060
love to exploit. And don't forget to
backup your data.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.880
If malware ever locks you out of your
files, having a backup ensures you

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.600
won't lose important data. Good cyber
hygiene helps keep your devices running

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.680
smoothly, prevents cyber threats, and
helps keep your accounts safe.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.120
When hackers can't crack your accounts,
they move on to easier targets.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.100
Keeping up with all this sounds like a
hassle, right?
